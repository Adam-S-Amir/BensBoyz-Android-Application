To implement an online pickup in-store functionality for the Android app using Shopify, follow these general steps:

Set up Shopify Store: If you haven't already, create a Shopify store or use an existing one. Ensure that your products are properly listed and configured in your Shopify dashboard.

Install Shopify SDK: Use the Shopify SDK to integrate Shopify features into your Android app. You can find the SDK and installation instructions on the Shopify developer website.

Authenticate Your App: Set up OAuth authentication to allow your Android app to access data from your Shopify store. This involves registering your app with Shopify and obtaining API credentials.

Fetch Products: Use the Shopify SDK to fetch the list of products available in your store. You can display these products in your app to allow users to browse and select items for pickup.

Implement Cart Functionality: Allow users to add products to a shopping cart within your app. Use the Shopify SDK to manage the cart and update it as users add or remove items.

Checkout Process: Implement the checkout process to allow users to complete their order. Depending on your requirements, you may need to collect additional information such as pickup location and contact details.

Order Confirmation: Once the user has completed the checkout process, handle the order confirmation and provide feedback to the user. You can display a confirmation message and provide details about the pickup process.

Notification: Optionally, implement notification features to notify users when their order is ready for pickup. You can use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or other notification services for this purpose.

Testing: Thoroughly test your app to ensure that all features work as expected. Test various scenarios, including adding items to the cart, checking out, and receiving notifications.
